# Git commands

> delete local branch: git branch -d branch-name
> delete remote branch: git branch -D branch-name
> merge: git merge branch-name
> checkout branch: git checkout branch-name
> commit: git commit -m "commit-message"
> reset commited changes before push: git reset --soft HEAD~1

--- Squash ---

1. Squash last 6 commits = add last 5 commits into the 6th:
# git reset --soft HEAD~6
2. This generates Staged changes that need to be commited
# git commit -m "custom message: squashing last 6 commits"

Using interactive rebase:
# git rebase -i HEAD~6
The first line is the most recent one. leave it to pick.
All the other ones can be squashed.
After editing using vim do :wq
Now you have to pick a commit message
After performing the squash procedure you have to push using -f to overwrite the existing changes in branch:
# git push -f

--- Fixup ---

1. Stage any changed that need to be added to an older commit
# git add *
2. Perform the commit to fix broken 0edafa89772
# git commit --fixup=<<0edafa89772(commit id)>>
3. Merge fixup commit into broken commit
# git rebase -i --autosquash 0edafa89772~1
4. Push changes to bitbucket

--- Clone ---

# git clone https://dianaturcoman@bitbucket.org/ibsolution_de/cap-onboarding.git

--- List all branches ---

# git branch -a

--- View checked-out(current) branch ---

# git branch --show-current

--- Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch / local repository

# git pull

More precisely, "git pull" runs "git fetch" with the given parameters and then depending on configuration options or command line flags, will call either "git rebase" or "git merge" to reconcile diverging branches.
git pull
git fetch

--- create a new branch from the current branch. It also automatically switches to the new branch. And takes in the changes which were not commited.

# git checkout -b <<new_branch_name>>

--- Merge current selected branch with new branch ---

Select branch to be merged:
# git checkout <<destination branch name / main / develop>>
Merge
# git merge <<source branch name / feature/branch_name>>
# git push

--- Delete local branch ---

# git branch -D feature/diana-1

--- Checkout branch and Tag ---

# git tag

--- List tags ---

# git tag -n
# git tag --list

--- Rename branch locally and remote ---

# git checkout <<branch to be renamed>>
# git branch -m <<new name>>
# git push origin :<<branch old name>> <<branch new name>>

reset of the upstream branch:
# git branch --unset-upstream
# git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<<branch new name on main>> <<branch new name on local>>

--- Update GitHub branches structure to local repository

Clean git remote branches that show up on local but were deleted from remote

# git remote prune origin
# git fetch origin --prune
Prefered: # git fetch --prune

deletes branch references to remote branches that do not exist. A remote branch can be deleted as a result of a delete-branch-after merge-operation.

--- Local branches need to be deleted manually

# git branch --v
-> find the "gone" branches
# git branch -D <<branch name>>

--- Abort merge when too many conflicts

# git merge --abort

--- Fetch branch that exists only on remote, but not locally

# git fetch origin <<branch name>>
# git checkout <<branch name>>

------- Cloud Application Programing -------------------------------

install in VSCode the CDS extension

run
$ cds

create project
$ cds init d693-cap-demo
$ cd d693-cap-demo

run project
$ cds watch

------- Cloud Foundry in BAS terminal -------------------------------

--- ES Lint ---
---------------

eslint --ext .ts src
(pnpm run lint / pnpm run lint:fix)

------------
--- PNPM ---
------------

- update pnpm:

1. check current version: pnpm -v
2. go to sourceforge.net/projects/pnpm.mirror
3. download the latest win-x64 exe file
4. open Environment Variables. search for the path to the nodejs app
5. backup the pnpm.exe located in the nodejs path.
6. copy the downloaded pnpm file to $nodejs$/pnpm.exe
7. check new version: pnpm -v

- update all packages:

pnpm up --latest

---------------
--- Node JS ---
---------------

1. check current node version: node -v (2.11.0)
2. list current node version available locally: nvm list
3. install latest version: nvm install 22
4. use latest installed version: nvm use 22
5. when installing a new node verion, then the pnpm file needs to be copied in the new $/nvm/vxxx/pnpm.exe folder

------------------------
--- install packages ---
------------------------

Remove node_modules via cmd:
> npkill

Check outdated packages:
> npm outdated

To update all dependencies, if you are confident this is desirable:
> npm update

To update a single dependency such as xml2js:
> npm update xml2js

npm update --workspace=@mycompany/some-package-name

ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
